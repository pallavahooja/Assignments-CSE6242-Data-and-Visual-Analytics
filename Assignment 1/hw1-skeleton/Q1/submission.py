# All instructions, code comments, etc. contained within this notebook are part of the assignment instructions.
# Portions of this file will auto-graded in Gradescope using different sets of parameters / data to ensure that values are not
# hard-coded.
#
# Instructions:  Implement all methods in this file that have a return
# value of 'NotImplemented'. See the documentation within each method for specific details, including
# the expected return value
#
# Helper Functions:
# You are permitted to write additional helper functions/methods or use additional instance variables within
# the `Graph` class or `TMDbAPIUtils` class so long as the originally included methods work as required.
#
# Use:
# The `Graph` class  is used to represent and store the data for the TMDb co-actor network graph.  This class must
# also provide some basic analytics, i.e., number of nodes, edges, and nodes with the highest degree.
#
# The `TMDbAPIUtils` class is used to retrieve Actor/Movie data using themoviedb.org API.  We have provided a few necessary methods
# to test your code w/ the API, e.g.: get_move_detail(), get_movie_cast(), get_movie_credits_for_person().  You may add additional
# methods and instance variables as desired (see Helper Functions).
#
# The data that you retrieve from the TMDb API is used to build your graph using the Graph class.  After you build your graph using the
# TMDb API data, use the Graph class write_edges_file & write_nodes_file methods to produce the separate nodes and edges
# .csv files for use with the Argo-Lite graph visualization tool.
#
# While building the co-actor graph, you will be required to write code to expand the graph by iterating
# through a portion of the graph nodes and finding similar artists using the TMDb API. We will not grade this code directly
# but will grade the resulting graph data in your Argo-Lite graph snapshot.

#
# BUILDING YOUR GRAPH
#
# Working with the API:  See use of http.request: https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.client.html#examples
#
# Using TMDb's API, build a co-actor network for the actor's/actress' highest rated movies
# In this graph, each node represents an actor
# An edge between any two nodes indicates that the two actors/actresses acted in a movie together
# i.e., they share a movie credit.
# e.g., An edge between Samuel L. Jackson and Robert Downey Jr. indicates that they have acted in one
# or more movies together.
#
# For this assignment, we are interested in a co-actor network of highly rated movies; specifically,
# we only want the top 3 co-actors in each movie credit of an actor having a vote average >= 8.0.
#
# You will need to add extra functions or code to accomplish this.  We will not directly call or explicitly grade your
# algorithm. We will instead measure the correctness of your output by evaluating the data in your argo-lite graph
# snapshot.
#
# Build your co-actor graph on the actress 'Meryl Streep' w/ person_id 5064.
# Initialize a Graph object with a single node representing Meryl Streep
# Find all of Meryl Streep's movie credits that have a vote average >= 8.0
#
# 1. For each movie credit:
#   get the movie cast members having an 'order' value between 0-2 (these are the co-actors)
#   for each movie cast member:
#       using graph.add_node(), add the movie cast member as a node (keep track of all new nodes added to the graph)
#       using graph.add_edge(), add an edge between the Meryl Streep (actress) node
#       and each new node (co-actor/co-actress)
#
#
# Using the nodes added in the first iteration (this excludes the original node of Meryl Streep!)
#
# 2. For each node (actor / actress) added in the previous iteration:
#   get the movie credits for the actor that have a vote average >= 8.0
#   for each movie credit:
#       try to get the 3 movie cast members having an 'order' value between 0-2
#       for each movie cast member:
#           if the node doesn't already exist:
#               add the node to the graph (track all new nodes added to the graph)
#               if the edge does not exist:
#                   add an edge between the node (actor) and the new node (co-actor/co-actress)
#
#
# - Repeat the steps from # 2. until you have iterated 3 times to build an appropriately sized graph.
# - Your graph should not have any duplicate edges or nodes
# - Write out your finished graph as a nodes file and an edges file using
#   graph.write_edges_file()
#   graph.write_nodes_file()
#
# Exception handling and best practices
# - You should use the param 'language=en-US' in all API calls to avoid encoding issues when writing data to file.
# - If the actor name has a comma char ',' it should be removed to prevent extra columns from being inserted into the .csv file
# - Some movie_credits may actually be collections and do not return cast data. Handle this situation by skipping these instances.
# - While The TMDb API does not have a rate-limiting scheme in place, consider that making hundreds / thousands of calls
#   can occasionally result in timeout errors. It may be necessary to insert periodic sleeps when you are building your graph.
